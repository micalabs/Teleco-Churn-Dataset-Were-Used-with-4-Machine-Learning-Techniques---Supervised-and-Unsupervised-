# Teleco-Churn-Dataset-Were-Used-with-4-Machine-Learning-Techniques---Supervised-and-Unsupervised-


This is part of the project completed during my Certificaate Program in Big Data Analytics at the York University, Torornto, Canada. A comprehensive project submission was made for mark in the last course in a PDF formar. This is the code aspect of the project.

I believe this can benefit young and aspiring Data Science in this Field.

# Telco Customer Churn Data Set

This Tutorial makes use of Teleco Customer Churn Data set, where the aim is to predict the customer that would churn or not.

#Context
"Predict behavior to retain customers. You can analyze all relevant customer data and develop focused customer retention programs." [IBM Sample Data Sets]

#Content
Each row represents a customer, each column contains customer’s attributes described on the column Metadata.

The data set includes information about:

- Customers who left within the last month – the column is called Churn
- Services that each customer has signed up for – phone, multiple lines, internet, online security, online backup, device protection, tech support, and streaming TV and movies
- account information – how long they’ve been a customer, contract, payment method, paperless billing, monthly charges, and total charges
- Demographic info about customers – gender, age range, and if they have partners and dependents

This dataset used in this Project can be downloaded from this link on kaggle.com - https://www.kaggle.com/blastchar/telco-customer-churn

This project code consists of data preparation, and used different Machine Learning Techniques such as

- Decision Tree
- Logistic Regression
- Random Forest
- K-Means Clustering 

The parameter were adjusted like three times in order to get good accuracy, e.g, like the Decision Tree, three decision tree model were developed and model evaluation were used to predict the best among the three model by adjucting the parameters. The Model Evaluation Models used are - Precision, Recall, ROC AUC, Confusion Matrix, Accuracy.
